# Gesture_Controlled_Trolley_System
This project is to design a trolley system which can be controlled just by using simple hand gestures. Our main motive behind this is to reduce the hard work of carrying heavy loads from one place to another. It can also be used by handicapped people who cannot do locomotive moments. In this way, they donâ€™t need to move from their place, they can make their goods reach themselves just with basic hand gestures.
